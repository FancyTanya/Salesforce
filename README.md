# A large company wants to manage a sales process in Salesforce. 
## The system user is an *Agent*. The Agent uses four types of objects: *Product, Deal, Interest and Client*. 
## The Client may be interested in buying a Product. 
## The Agent can create a relationship between Client and Product (Interest) when some Client becomes a prospective customer. 
## The Agent should have a possibility to see all clients interested in Product and convert the Interest to the Deal.
